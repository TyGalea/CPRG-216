# REC Monthly Utility Bill Calculator - CPRG216 Assignment Programming Basics
#
# This program calculates the customerâ€™s total monthly utility bill in CDN$.
# The customer will first enter their account number, month, type of electricity plan,
# amount of electricity used (in kWh), type of natural gas plan, amount of natural gas 
# used (in GJ), and the province. The program will then calculate and display the customer's monthly
# utility charge by adding together the fixed monthly fee, the cost of electricity,
# the cost of gas, and the fixed monthly transaction fee. The program then calculates and display 
# the province sales tax from the customers province. Lastly, the program displays the total
# amount due by adding the monthly utility charge and province sales tax
