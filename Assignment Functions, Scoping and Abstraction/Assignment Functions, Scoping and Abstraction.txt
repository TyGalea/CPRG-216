# Quest Phones Profit Calculator - CPRG216 Assignment Programming Strategies
#
# This program asks the user about the cost of paint, the number of rooms to paint and the amount of
# coats to apply to each room. It asks the user details about each room such as the dimensions and the
# amount and size of the doors and windows in each room. The program will print a summary of each room.
# Lastly, a Customer Quote will be printed including the final estimated cost.

#  Function: main
#
#  This function first gets the paint price, the number of coats, and the number of rooms.
#  Then for every room it gets the type of room, calculates the area of the room and removes
#  the area of the doors and windows of the room. The area is multiplied by the number of coats
#  and a summary of the room is printed. The total number of windows and doors and the total are
#  are updated. This loops through every room that is being painted. Lastly, the function prints out
#  a Customer Quote that has the number of coats of paint, the total area to paint, the gallons of paint
#  needed, and the final cost.
#
#  Parameters: None
#  Returns   : None
